# GitHub Query Chatbot

## Overview
This project introduces a BERT-based chatbot designed to assist new software engineers by answering queries related to Git and GitHub operations. By leveraging the transformer architecture, this chatbot provides insightful and accurate responses, thereby facilitating quicker learning and skill acquisition. This initiative aims to bridge the gap in accessing job opportunities for early-career software engineers by enhancing their proficiency with essential development tools.

## Dataset & Preprocessing
The chatbot is trained on a curated dataset comprising questions and answers about common Git and GitHub issues. This dataset includes a wide range of topics from basic repository setup and branch management to more complex issues like merge conflicts and GitHub Actions. The data is sourced from publicly available GitHub documentation and community Q&A forums to ensure a comprehensive coverage of topics. Prior to training, the data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and encoding to fit the model's input requirements.

## Model Architecture & Training
The chatbot utilizes the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model architecture, which allows it to understand the context of a query better than traditional models. Training involves fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on our specific dataset, using a sequence classification head to predict the most appropriate responses based on user inputs.

## Components
- **BERT Model:** Core component for understanding and generating responses.
- **Query Processor:** Parses and preprocesses user queries.
- **Response Generator:** Selects or generates appropriate responses based on the model's predictions.
- **User Interface:** Simple command-line or web-based interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** Initially set to 5e-5, with dynamic adjustments based on validation loss.
- **Batch Size:** 16 for training, 8 for validation.
- **Number of Epochs:** Up to 10, depending on convergence criteria.

## Performance Metrics
### Training & Validation
- **Precision and Recall:** Measures the relevance of the chatbot's responses to the queries.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback collected from users regarding the chatbot's effectiveness and usability.

## Example Interactions
- **User:** How do I revert a commit in Git?
- **Chatbot:** You can revert a commit by using `git revert <commit-hash>`. This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.

- **User:** What's the best way to resolve merge conflicts?
- **Chatbot:** To resolve merge conflicts, open the conflicting files and make the necessary changes. After editing, mark the conflicts as resolved using `git add <file-name>`, then continue your rebase or merge.

- **User:** How do I set up GitHub Actions for my project?
- **Chatbot:** You can set up GitHub Actions by creating a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository and adding workflow YAML files to define your actions.

## Challenges Faced

Throughout the development of the GitHub Query Chatbot, several significant challenges were encountered that provided learning opportunities and shaped the final implementation:

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Quality**
Finding high-quality, relevant training data for the chatbot was a major challenge. GitHub queries are highly specific, and publicly available datasets did not fully cover the scope of questions new developers might ask. To address this, data had to be supplemented from various sources, including community forums and official documentation, which required extensive preprocessing to standardize and make it usable for training.

### 2. **Model Fine-Tuning and Optimization**
BERT models are powerful, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks like answering GitHub queries required careful adjustment of hyperparameters. Balancing model complexity with performance to avoid overfitting while maintaining a good response time was challenging. Trials included adjusting learning rates, epochs, and batch sizes to find the optimal settings for both accuracy and efficiency.

### 3. **Understanding and Implementing BERT**
As BERT is a relatively complex model involving advanced concepts in NLP, fully understanding and implementing its architecture was a challenge, particularly ensuring that the transformer mechanisms were properly utilized to capture the context of user queries effectively.

### 4. **Integration and Interface Design**
Creating an intuitive user interface that could be easily used by new developers posed another challenge. The goal was to make the chatbot accessible through simple commands or a web interface, which required seamless integration of the front-end and back-end components.
