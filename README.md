# GitHub Query Chatbot

## Overview
This project introduces a BERT-based chatbot designed to assist new software engineers by answering queries related to Git and GitHub operations. By leveraging the transformer architecture, this chatbot provides insightful and accurate responses, thereby facilitating quicker learning and skill acquisition. This initiative aims to bridge the gap in accessing job opportunities for early-career software engineers by enhancing their proficiency with essential development tools.

## Dataset & Preprocessing
The chatbot is trained on a curated dataset comprising questions and answers about common Git and GitHub issues. This dataset includes a wide range of topics from basic repository setup and branch management to more complex issues like merge conflicts and GitHub Actions. The data is sourced from publicly available GitHub documentation and community Q&A forums to ensure a comprehensive coverage of topics. Prior to training, the data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and encoding to fit the model's input requirements.

## Model Architecture & Training
The chatbot utilizes the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model architecture, which allows it to understand the context of a query better than traditional models. Training involves fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on our specific dataset, using a sequence classification head to predict the most appropriate responses based on user inputs.

## Components
- **BERT Model:** Core component for understanding and generating responses.
- **Query Processor:** Parses and preprocesses user queries.
- **Response Generator:** Selects or generates appropriate responses based on the model's predictions.
- **User Interface:** Simple command-line or web-based interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** Initially set to 5e-5, with dynamic adjustments based on validation loss.
- **Batch Size:** 16 for training, 8 for validation.
- **Number of Epochs:** Up to 10, depending on convergence criteria.

## Performance Metrics
### Training & Validation
- **Precision and Recall:** Measures the relevance of the chatbot's responses to the queries.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback collected from users regarding the chatbot's effectiveness and usability.

## Example Interactions
- **User:** How do I revert a commit in Git?
- **Chatbot:** You can revert a commit by using `git revert <commit-hash>`. This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.

- **User:** What's the best way to resolve merge conflicts?
- **Chatbot:** To resolve merge conflicts, open the conflicting files and make the necessary changes. After editing, mark the conflicts as resolved using `git add <file-name>`, then continue your rebase or merge.

- **User:** How do I set up GitHub Actions for my project?
- **Chatbot:** You can set up GitHub Actions by creating a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository and adding workflow YAML files to define your actions.

## Author's Note
This project was developed to help new software engineers get acquainted with GitHub, a crucial tool in modern software development. By providing a resource that accelerates the learning process, we aim to increase job accessibility and empower new engineers to become effective contributors in the tech community.
